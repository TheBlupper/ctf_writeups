# ImaginaryCTF 2022

I played this CTF with thehackerscrew and solved the following challenges

 - pyprison
 - pycorrectionalcenter
 - [One Liner: Revenge](revenge/README.md)
 - [xobeert](xobeert/README.md)
 - Jormungandr (really fun & cool challenge but I don't know how to make an interestign writeup for it, I just added debug prints everywhere and brute forced the `i` operation)

And contributed in solving wired


Might add more writeups over time
